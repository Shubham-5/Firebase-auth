# React Authentication using Firebase

Reactjs authentication using firebase authentication . The benefit of using this new version is that the final bundle size is much smaller compared to the previous - which in turn makes your React site efficient and load much faster.

## Why this?

You can use this template as a starting point for any application that needs authentication.

The template is based on [ChakraUI](https://chakra-ui.com/) (incl. **Dark Mode**), though you can use any UI library you like but you need to do the relevant changes and keep the code related to firebase authentication - **the logic remains the same in any UI**.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

_**Note**: Before running `npm start` do place the relevant environment variables in the `.env.local` file for firebase configuration._
